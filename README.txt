1. Detect the tree tops of the treetops visible from above.
2. Determine the heights of all recognized trees.
3. Based on the tree heights, estimate the breast height diameter (BHD) of all trees within the 
boundaries of the forest stand. Use the following BHD height allometry. Height H and BHD D 
both have the unit m:
H= 47∗ D(0.5)
4. Create a map of the diameter distribution of the forest stand
5. Calculate the average basal area (m²/ha) of the forest stand
